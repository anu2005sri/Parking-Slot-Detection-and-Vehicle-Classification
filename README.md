# Parking-Slot-Detection-and-Vehicle-Classification
             Optimize parking management by using computer vision and machine learning for detecting and recognizing vehicle registration plates. The system automates vehicle identification, allocates parking spaces, and stores details efficiently. AI-generated voice output provides real-time vehicle information to streamline the process.

In our project, we place a CCTV camera at the entrance (ex: shopping malls) to detect the number plates of incoming cars.

Another CCTV camera is placed in the parking area. It detects the number of free spaces, shows red boxes for occupied slots and green boxes for free slots, and also tracks how long a car has stayed. If people walk in a slot, it detects that no car is there. When a car enters, the box turns red. Using the entrance cameraâ€™s number plate detection, the system can guide each car to its exact slot, for example: ðŸ”Š â€˜There are 12 free parking spaces available. TN09BY9726 car, please go to slot number 7.â€™

It also lists the cars parked in each slot one by one, along with their plates number , photos and vehicle type.
